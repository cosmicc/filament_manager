# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 08.05.2026

### Added

- Complete FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL Filament Manager application with local Administrator, Operator, and Viewer accounts.
- Canonical inventory, immutable physical measurements and usage, material profiles, the exact six-step calibration workflow, printers, and P1-P5 build plates.
- Hash-bound workbook dry-run and commit import, QR spool labels, append-only audit history, transactional outbox, and scheduled reconciliation workers.
- Supported Spoolman REST, Moonraker, Google Sheets publication, local Docker Compose, independent production Swarm stacks, migrations, health checks, metrics, and operational documentation.
- Workshop Navy light and dark design system, responsive printer-side weighing flow, automated backend/frontend tests, and rendered validation references.
- Cross-platform Cura workstation agent for Arch Linux and Windows 11 with one-time pairing, automatic Cura/machine discovery, outbound-only deployment polling, complete material and quality profile rendering, guarded pressure-advance injection, automatic backup, atomic writes, checksums, and rollback.
- Cura workstation management and deployment history UI, one-click deployment to every active agent, hardened systemd user and Windows logon-task installers, standalone binary build workflow, API lifecycle tests, and isolated local-agent tests.

### Changed

- Standardized the product and all technical identifiers on Filament Manager.
- Made PostgreSQL authoritative while preserving standalone Spoolman as the printer-facing operational service and the workbook as an initial-import fixture.
- Adapted the approved Workshop Navy palette into consistent light and dark application themes.
- Replaced the frontend routing dependency with a small same-origin History API router after dependency review.
- Changed Cura profile delivery from download-only JSON to optional automated, agent-scoped deployment while retaining manual export.

### Fixed

- Preserved the corrected `P11-S` workbook identifier so every imported physical spool code is unique.
- Made the initial migration fully reversible, preserved unknown Spoolman extension fields, and established an unknown tare atomically with its first measurement.
- Raised the development test-tool floor to the patched Pytest 9 release identified by dependency audit.
- Removed package-manager and build tooling from the non-root production image after runtime dependency audit.
- Separated local PostgreSQL administrator, canonical application, and Spoolman roles and limited the bootstrap password to its one-shot Compose service.
- Preserved restrictive host secret permissions during local PostgreSQL initialization through an ephemeral privilege-drop handoff.
- Prevented Cura writes while Cura is running, path escapes and symlink traversal, ambiguous machine targeting, unbounded agent metadata, credential replay, and unsafe replacement of unknown inherited start G-code.
